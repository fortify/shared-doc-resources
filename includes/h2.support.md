## Support

For general assistance, please join the [Fortify Community](https://community.opentext.com/cybersec/fortify/) to get tips and tricks from other users and the OpenText team.
 
OpenText customers can contact our world-class [support team](https://www.opentext.com/support/opentext-enterprise/) for questions, enhancement requests and bug reports. You can also raise questions and issues through your OpenText Fortify representative like Customer Success Manager or Technical Account Manager if applicable.

You may also consider raising questions or issues through the [GitHub Issues page]({{var:repo-url}}/issues) (if available for this repository), providing public visibility and allowing anyone (including all contributors) to review and comment on your question or issue. Note that this requires a GitHub account, and given public visibility, you should refrain from posting any confidential data through this channel.
