The software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, and is not supported through the regular Micro Focus Support channels. Support requests may be submitted through the [GitHub Issues]({project_issues}) page for this repository. A (free) GitHub account is required to submit new issues or to comment on existing issues. 

Support requests created through the GitHub Issues page may include bug reports, enhancement requests and general usage questions. Please avoid creating duplicate issues by checking whether there is any existing issue, either open or closed, that already addresses your question, bug or enhancement request. If an issue already exists, please add a comment to provide additional details if applicable.

Support requests on the GitHub Issues page are handled on a best-effort basis; there is no guaranteed response time, no guarantee that reported bugs will be fixed, and no guarantee that enhancement requests will be implemented. If you require dedicated support for this and other Fortify software, please consider purchasing Micro Focus Fortify Professional Services. Micro Focus Fortify Professional Services can assist with general usage questions, integration of the software into your processes, and implementing customizations, bug fixes, and feature requests (subject to feasibility analysis).
